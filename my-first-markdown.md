# Hello Markdown!

It is **soo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hand on *it*, you _**just**_:

* remember the basic syntax
* write your doc
* Done!

here is code `std::cout << "Hello Markdown!" << std::endl;`

and more code

```
int main ()
{ 
  std::cout << "Hello Markdown!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

here what people say about it:
> It is incredible! Absolutely fantastic!
>
> So easy and so powerful!
